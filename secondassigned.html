    <h4>Life is just like a cup of tea its all in how you make it and always believe that u can and you’re halfway
        there.</h4>
    </p>Though their are so many people which inspire us whether they are our own friends or relatives or may be some other people but exactly speaking that the real inspiration which anyone can get is from a book as books have the power to inspire and do much more things.
    Books are our truest friends who provide us with a treasure house of knowledge and information .Much like our friends ,they give us inspiration and encourage us to do great things .We get pleasure from reading the stories of far away lands and from learning about the mysteries of the universe .we get motivated by the biographies of great men and are inspired to follow in their footsteps .They help us to overcome our shortcomings and sculpt us into ideal human beings .

<p><h2>The beautiful story of the marble statue</h2></p>
<p><h4>In the middle of a beautiful city, there was a museum laid with beautiful marble tiles and with a huge marble statue as a part of the display. Many people from all over the world visited the museum every day and admired the beautifully crafted statue. One night, the marble tiles started talking to the marble statue.
    Marble Tiles: Hey statue, Don’t you think that it is just not fair that everybody from all over the world come all the way here to admire you while ignoring and stepping on me.
    Marble Statue: My dear brother, marble tile, Don’t you remember we are actually from the same cave.
    Marble Tile: Yes! I do, that is why i feel it is even more unfair. Both of us were born from the same cave and yet the world treats us so differently now. This is so unfair!
    Marble Statue: Yes you are right my brother. But, do you still remember the day when the sculptor tried to work on you but you resisted his tools.
    Marble Tiles: Yes, I despise that guy. How could he use those nasty tools on me.
    Marble Statue: Well, Since you resisted his tools he couldn’t work on you. When he decided to give up on you, he started working on me instead. I knew at once that i would be something different and unique after his efforts. I bore all the painful tools he used on me and allowed him craft me as he wanted!
    Marble Tiles: But those tools were so painful.
    Marble Statue: My brother, there is a price for everything in life. Since, you decided to resist and gave up half way, you can’t blame anybody who steps on you now.!
    The marble tiles silently listened to his brothers words. and started to reflect on it.
    </h4></p>
    <p><h4>Moral: The harder the knocks you go through in life, the more you learn and put them to use in the future! Do not be discouraged by setbacks and failures! Keep trying to be better.

    <p><h2>IS INSPIRATION A NECESSITY?????</h2></p>

    <P><h4>Thomas Edison once said, “Genius is one part inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.” And while there’s no discounting the tremendous value of the latter, the former is what sets the wheels in motion. Here’s a closer look at inspiration, along with tips for finding inspiration of your own.
        All of which begs the questions: If inspiration only accounts for one percent of optimal output, then why is it so important both in school and at work?
        Anyone who’s ever tried to force inspiration knows that it’s easier said than done. But this doesn’t mean you need to sit back and wait for it to strike.In other words, while may not be able to call for inspiration and expect it to come, we can take steps to open the door to inspiration</h4></P>

<p>The following are the basic fundas of life.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make a move.</li>
    <li> Stay in learning mode.</li>    
    <li>Expand your social network.</li>   
    <li>Limit your choices.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <h3>One last thing to keep in mind? We’ve all heard the adage “practice makes perfect,” and cultivating inspiration is no different: The more regularly you practice inspiration, the easier finding it will become.</h3>
